# Arduino sketches 


# Bandpass filter tester (sketch bpf_tester.ino)

 You can use the __bpf_tester.ino__ sketch to check your circuit. 
 This sketch is also useful to guide the user how to control the auto bandpass filter handleing teh Auduino pins direct. 


 # Bandpass filter deiver (folder pu2clr_autobpf_driver)

 It is a small Arduino library to make easier the auto bandpass filter to be used with your Arduino solution.  In this folder you will find the AutoBPF library (.h and .cpp files) and the sketch pu2clr_autobpf_driver.ino. The pu2clr_autobpf_driver.ino sketch is useful to check your BPF circuit; to test the AutoBPF library; and to guide the user
